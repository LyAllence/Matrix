Project:
  This project is to deal with multiplication at big matrix(maybe above one billion)
  And we will use distribute frame
  And the project is base on python 3.6
  And we will have four scripts, two socket server, one client and one script to multiplication matrix

Script:
  matrix_multiplication_script detail script to deal with matrix
  issued_task_client issued task script
  total_server_service total socket server, send all matrix to clients and accept all response of clients.
  part_server_service part socket server, to accept matrix from total server and use matrix_multiplication_script to
    deal with matrix

Multiplication:
  per time we will send base matrix to per client, if have other matrix, send to client after the client is finish
  it's work, maybe some client will irq, and it not finish working also will send to other client.

All Process:
   One step: we send a task with issued_task_client, and we need enter a task to run the script. the one will send task to
         server and client
   Two step: client will  request the total with send the task name. total will send matrix to client
   Three step: client compute the matrix and send result to total
   Four step: total receive the result and judge the result is partial or not. if true, close the client, if false.
         inspect the all matrix if complex or not. if finish ,exit , if not goon
