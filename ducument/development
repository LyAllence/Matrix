Data format:
  send message to socket server, to avoid tcp splicing.
    one step: send length of next message with int(4 bit)
    two step: send message to socket server

Socket:
  To improve efficiency of socket, we'll use one client, one deal.
  So, we'll have client and server with one machine.

Achieve
  matrix_multiplication_script detail script to deal with matrix

  issued_task_client
    Accept three parameters, task name, matrix file(the file must be loaded by json), and client address.
    Owing to maybe have some address is not connected in those, so our address is true in total socket server accepted,
    And we need send the task name and matrix file to total socket server and the task name to all address in the script.

  total_server_service total socket server, send all matrix to clients and accept all response of clients.

  part_server_service part socket server, to accept matrix from total server and use matrix_multiplication_script to
    deal with matrix

File:
  we have two directory, one is data, to storage all matrix, and child file is task:matrix.
  and other file is result, and child file is task:matrix


process: partial send request to total, total response the matrix to client, client compute result, and send it to total.
